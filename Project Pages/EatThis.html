                    <h5>Created: March 6, 2023</h5>
                    <h5>Type: Major-Type</h5>
                    <h5>Description: Born from one of Kalen's favorite foods, Cookies Galore covers the history of
                        multiple of the most well known and obscure cookies across the world. Nine cookies are listed
                        here, ranging from the legendary Chocolate Chip, all the way to the lower rated Triggel. Even
                        Kalen learned a thing or two while creating this website, mostly seen in the section dedicated
                        to the Fortune Cookie.</h5>
                    <h5>Fun Fact: The obscure section was the hardest to fill out. This is because Kalen had to go
                        through multiple websites about cookies to find the right choices, yet he could normally find
                        ones that he at least heard about. So he had to dig deeper. Thus, all the cookies listed in the
                        obscure section were from the lowest rated cookies in the world.</h5>
