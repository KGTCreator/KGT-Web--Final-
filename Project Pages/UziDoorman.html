                    <h5><a href="https://kgtcreator.github.io/A-Website-About-Liam-Vickers/">Visit The Website</a></h5>
                    <h5>Created: February 14, 2023</h5>
                    <h5>Type: Major-Type</h5>
                    <h5>Description: As you saw in the About Me page, Kalen is a massive fan of Murder Drones, and
                        slowly learned about the series creator, Liam Vickers. And so, when given the oportunity to
                        write about some kind of creator he knows about, Liam Vickers was selected. The website itself
                        is an in-depth look at the backstory of Liam, while also covering his works, and artstyle. While
                        the website was a joy to work on, the accordion function was an absolute nightmare! This only
                        seemed reasonable since it was the first project to mainly use JavaScript. It took that one
                        section two days to be fixed! But in the end, it still served as a nice tribute to the goofy
                        edgelord!</h5>
                    <h5>Fun Fact: The website was not only made as a tribute to Liam, but it was also made to celebrate
                        the release of Murder Drones Episode 3: The Promening(Febuary 17 2023)! It is what won the
                        decision over Kalen's other choice, Don Bluth.</h5>
