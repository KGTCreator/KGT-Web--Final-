                    <h5>Description: In the spirit of St Patrick's Day, this website was made to promote a fictional
                        lottery system based in Ireland. Kalen went through the extra effort of giving the titular
                        lottery company a backstory, with a lucky Leprechaun named Patrick Leppy, and his want to give
                        good luck to as many people as possible. It was a fun little project that included small
                        refrences to Ireland and a few sponsoring companies as well.</h5>
                    <h5>Fun Fact: The name, Patrick Leppy, was derived from two separate sources. "Patrick" came from St
                        Patrick himself. While "Leppy" was based on the name of a character made by Fusion Animations,
                        for his small St Patty's Day video, The Little Leprechaun of Seattle.</h5>
