                    <h5>Description: The first example of a successful animation from Tobin! This website is not much,
                        but it was his first completed animation that he made, not only in html code, but in general.
                        Shockingly, it didn't break apart halfway!</h5>
                    <h5>Fun Fact: Before starting this website, Kalen had created another website that involved an
                        animations. This was called, "The Mysterious Spider" and it ended up as a MESS! This one was
                        much cleaner, and easier to work with, and that leads to this.</h5>
