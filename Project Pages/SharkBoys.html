                    <h5>Description: This project was one of the earliest Kalen ever made. A TCA during Sophomore year,
                        this website displays some of the most famous sea creatures and ranking them from top to bottom.
                        This was the very first time that Kalen had used effects on images. Every last picture has a
                        shaking effect whenever you hover over them. Makes the site more alive, ya know?</h5>
                    <h5>Fun Fact: This may be classified as the first "major-type" project that Tobin has made. It was
                        one of the first he made to properly utilize the navbar feature and had some of the first image
                        animations. </h5>
