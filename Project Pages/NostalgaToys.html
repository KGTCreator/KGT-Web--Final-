                        Well, Little Bird Toys is for you! This site was made to promote a fictional toy company that
                        specializes in making timeless wooden toys. It was the last project Kalen worked on for the
                        2022-2023 school year.</h5>
                    <h5>Fun Fact: The story behind the company was mostly filled in by Kalen himself, who filled in the
                        blanks from the resources he received. Along with that, this was the first, and for a while
                        only, website Kalen made with a functioning carousel!</h5>
