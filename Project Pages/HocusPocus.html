                    <h5>Created: October 6, 2022</h5>
                    <h5>Type: Major-Type</h5>
                    <h5>Description: Made for the spooky season of Halloween. This project was made in collaberation
                        with Dominic, and as seen, it is one of the highest quality websites Kalen has made. This
                        website is made as a tribute and explanation to the Sanderson Sisters of the hit movie, Hocus
                        Pocus, and its sequal! It may not be Halloween, but give it a look anyway!</h5>
                    <h5>Fun Fact: Kalen selected these characters for the website because the second movie had released
                        less than a week before the site started development! It was so new at the time, that there had
                        to be a spoiler warning at the top of the page to warn readers to see Hocus Pocus 2 before
                        seeing the website.</h5>
