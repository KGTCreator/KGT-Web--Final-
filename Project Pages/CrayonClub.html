                    <h5>Created: November 3, 2023</h5>
                    <h5>Type: Major-Type</h5>
                    <h5>Description: This website was designed to promote the Crayon Initiative Club at MHS, which sent
                        pounds of crayons to the real initiative in California. This site was made as part of a lesson
                        about making website for clients that wanted promotion. Since Kalen was in the club, it was an
                        easy choice.</h5>
                    <h5>Fun Fact: The club itself actually lost traction about a month after the website was created! At
                        the time, they had too many crayons to store, and were preparing to send them off to California.
                        Most of those donations were by Kalen.</h5>
