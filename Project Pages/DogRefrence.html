                    <h5>Description: Imagine, if you will, a restaurant that serves dogs, along with you! A kind of
                        place where you can bring your dog to have a meal along side you. That's what this website
                        represents! Based on a kind of restaurant that Ms Leonard had found on her travels, A Dog's Brew
                        is made to recreate what the website of this particular restaurant would look like. It contains
                        refernces to movies, links to KGT Studios, and a logo Kalen made in Photoshop. It was one of the
                        first Major-Type websites Kalen ever made!</h5>
                    <h5>Fun Fact: The name of the made-up restaurant, A Dog's Brew, was based on the many movies with
                        similar names. These include A Dog's Purpose, A Dog's Journey, and A Dog's Way Home!</h5>
